======================

The is a demo for a potential static site hosted on github pages.

Page is available at:

http://boo-language.github.io/

These are static web files, which are actually generated by a [mynt](http://mynt.uhnomoli.com/) (a simple static site generator like Jekyl), which is available [here](https://github.com/boo-language/website_mynt_project).

Contributions should be made to that repository as these file will get overwritten by Mynt.
